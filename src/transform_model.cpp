    // the cursor (ComputeFixedPointOffset) because a sprite AT the cursor's real position only sits
    // on correct content when T(L) == L. But Wind's identity is the centered cursor, and the render
    // model's mapper already solves the whole centered geometry - including the edge zones, where
    // cursorScreen slides away from the center as the source rect clamps. So use the mapper's
    // CENTERED source rect for the transform and park the sprite at r.cursorScreen (screen px;
    // layered windows composite OUTSIDE the magnification, so screen coords are its native space):
    //   - content at the lens center (r.centerX/Y) displays at screen center; the sprite sits there;
    //   - the hidden REAL cursor is SetCursorPos'd to clickDesktop (= the lens center rounded), so a
    //     click lands exactly on the aimed content - same invariant as the render model;
    //   - at the edges the mapper moves cursorScreen off-center in lockstep with the clamped source,
    //     so sprite, content, and click point stay welded there too.
    // Bonus vs the old anchored design: the sprite now barely MOVES (center, except at edges), which
    // kills the sprite-lags-the-view wobble that plagued the anchored model during pans.
    // KEEP-ALIVE v2 (issue #148 action-start spike): DWM discards its magnification resources
    // when the transform VALUE sits still and pays a ~1fps rebuild on the next real change.
    // v1 jittered the LEVEL by an epsilon - that forced a full re-SCALE of every cached surface
    // every tick, whose cost grows with zoom (constant ~1fps at 16x: the cure was the disease).
    // v2 jitters only the private-channel TRANSLATION by 1 screen px on alternating ticks - a
    // re-COMPOSITE of already-scaled surfaces, cheap at any level - and only while within 1.5s
    // of the last REAL change: brief pauses (the pan-stop-pan pattern) stay hot, while true idle
    // lets DWM park legitimately (one spike after a long idle is acceptable; one per pause was not).
    // Ramp cost limiter (measured: 150-215ms spikes during zoom ramps at high level): every LEVEL
    // change makes DWM re-scale its cached surfaces, and the cost grows with the level. Apply the
    // ramping level at most every 3rd tick (48Hz on a 144Hz panel - visually still a smooth ramp);
